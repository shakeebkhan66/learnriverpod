1. Provider
Provider is great for accessing dependencies and objects that donâ€™t change.
You may use this to access a repository, a logger, or some other class that doesn't contain mutable state.

2. StateProvider
StateProvider is great for storing simple state objects that can change, such as a counter value.
StateProvider is ideal for storing simple state variables, such as enums, strings, booleans, and
numbers. Notifier can also be used for the same purpose and is more flexible. For more complex or
asynchronous state, use AsyncNotifierProvider, FutureProvider, or StreamProvider as described below.

3. StateNotifierProvider
StateNotifierProvider and StateNotifier are ideal for managing state that may change in reaction
to an event or user interaction.
